# FreiCAR Presentation Rules

*UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

The complete presentation should not exceed 20 minutes. All team members have to speak.

## Hints
- Make it interesting: Show practical examples of the algorithms you used. If there are, show failure cases that illustrate pros and cons of the selected approach.
- Images and Videos say more than 1000 words.
- Do not re-explain content that was covered in the lectures. If you implemented something outside of the scope of the lecture, feel free to briefly explain it.
- In what way is your car special and stands out from the other cars?
## Grading

The team of supervisors determines a grade for the presentation based on the quality of the talk and based on the performance in the competition.
