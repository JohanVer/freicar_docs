 # FreiCAR Competition Checklist

1. Upload your code to a private git repository.
2. Read the code_testing section.
3. Please insert your competition github repo link and the launch command into this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1atN7fMslYkNw4Lp7cDsLqwp1TLAKHhY2NKlyGPJ_1tc/edit?usp=sharing).
Note that everything (code, launch command, ...) MUST be committed by March 25, 6am to be considered for the competition
4. Note that in order to receive the high-level commands you have to listen to the team-name "freicar_1". In the competition there may be other high-level commands on the topic that refer to other agents.
5. Make sure that you don't have any conflicts with the launch file that will run on our local machine  ```local_comp_launch.launch```
6. Make sure that you have a microphone and camera connected to your PC.
7. In your demonstration, one team member should provide some basic commentary on what the car is doing (not like a sports commentary but just to give people from outside your own team an idea of what the car is doing or trying to do)
